      Here's a shitty joke for you...
      <br>
      What's the difference between you and a bucket of shit?
      <br>
      <br>
      <span id="bucket">The bucket!!! Hahahaha! </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Boy did that frown
      <br> just turn upside down! 
      <br>
      <br>No? Here's a thought...
      Why don't you click that that button right there to see some magic?
